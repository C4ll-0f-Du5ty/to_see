        <h2>About Plan_B_Plate</h2>
        <p>
            Plan_B_Plate was inspired by the everyday struggle of finding meal ideas with limited ingredients. Whether
            you're a student or a professional, we often find ourselves asking, "What can I make with what I have?" This
            project offers a solution by making it easy to discover recipes based on available ingredients. As part of
            my journey at Holberton School, this project also reflects my passion for technology and cooking. I hope it
            helps others as much as it has helped me.
